										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>If you&#8217;re a Kenyan business person, you&#8217;re probably aware that Kenya&#8217;s tendering deals are what most businesses hunt day in and day out. Once you&#8217;ve acquired a supply of goods and product contracts, your business is promised to skyrocket above the shelves despite the country&#8217;s economic status.   The question that hits most Kenya business people and entrepreneurs is how does the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invitation_to_tender">Tendering Process </a>in Kenya operate? Ready? Let’s get started:</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>The Top things you should know about Kenya&#8217;s Tendering Process</strong></h4>



<p>Many Kenyan business operators have applied dozens of tenders without success. Many of them are left with the belief that those who are awarded those tenders are always related to the tender offering officials. Although this may be the case, it is not always true.                                                                So, what are the things you should know as a Kenyan business operator that can increase your chances of winning Kenyan tenders? Here&#8217;s what you should know and do:</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Know all the Kenyan Types of Tenders and their Financing Methods</strong></li></ul>



<p> The first thing you should do as a business person looking to acquire a tender in Kenya is to make sure you&#8217;ve absolute knowledge about all the types of tenders. This is to help you know and gauge the best tender that suits you in accordance to your business supply abilities and the tender demands.  With that said, here are the major types of tenders in the Kenya Tendering Process regulations:</p>



<p><a href="https://jengacash.com/blog/shipping-companies-in-kenya/">Get more information about the Shipping companies in Kenya</a></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Open Tenders</strong></li></ul>



<p>As the name suggests, this is the first and foremost Kenyan type of tender given by both the government and private sectors. Open tenders allow anyone willing to supply required goods and services to apply and provide opportunities to any organization to submit a tender.                             Here in Kenya and other countries, open tenders are mostly operating in the engineering and construction industries. The one significant advantage of open tenders is because it offers an excellent chance of competition between suppliers.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Selective Tenders</strong></li></ul>



<p>As you can see, selective tender means only selected individuals are eligible for the entire tendering process. This type of tender is where selected suppliers are allowed to apply and compete for their chances of securing work.                                                                                                             Suppliers selected in a selective tender are those who are known and have a proven record of supplying goods and products that meet the tender&#8217;s financial demands and size.</p>



<p>The advantage of selective tenders in Kenya is that it gives its clients a more excellent feeling of satisfaction that their suppliers will meet their demands. The other thing to note about selective tenders is that they don&#8217;t allow new firms and new business operators who are fresh in the Kenyan market to apply as they&#8217;re mostly not invited for applications.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Negotiated Tenders</strong></li></ul>



<p><strong>These types of tenders are also commonly open for specific industries such as the engineering and construction fields. Here&#8217;s why:</strong></p>



<p>As you can imagine, construction and engineering personals work under rules and regulations where once you give them your needs and demands of your project, a contract is always signed from the time of commencing to the time of resolution dispute.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Staged tenders</strong></li></ul>



<p>When it comes to these types of tenders, there are two types- the single staged and two-staged tenders.                                                                             Single–staged tenders happen when all the necessary and financial information to allow tender commencing are at hand. With single-stage tenders, an invitation is always given to prospective suppliers to apply. These tenders are also prepared and presented to suppliers to apply. Successful applicants are then invited for negotiations.</p>



<p><strong>Now that you know all the types of tenders in Kenya, here are other things you should keep in mind about Kenya&#8217;s tendering process:</strong></p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Get training to increase your chances of winning Kenyan Tenders</strong></li></ul>



<p>The best thing to do in Kenya to get a tender is knowing what you want first. Mostly, get tender experts&#8217; knowledge and ideas from tender officials and institutions.Getting advice and training will equip you with informed decisions and the dos and don&#8217;ts you&#8217;ll encounter.                                             If you&#8217;re wondering where you can get tender training in Kenya, start with centers like the Tender Hub of Kenya. This is an excellent tender institution that has been operating for many years.&nbsp; It offers not only tender training and advice but also tender listings.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li><strong>Know you desired tender&#8217;s financing method</strong></li></ul>



<p>Securing a tender isn&#8217;t all that you&#8217;ll want to know without knowing its financing method. Some tenders will require you to supply goods of a certain amount before you get your first pay. This can be harmful to your business if you accept a tender without checking the demands and regulations, yet you have a financial crisis.                                                                                                                                                                                                      Knowing your tender&#8217;s financing method helps you plan and decide if it is the right time for your business to accept such an invitation based on your finances.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to apply for a tender in Kenya</strong>,</h4>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>The idea of a multibet reigns among majority of bettors following the increased payouts they offer. Well, the outcome is very promising but there are instance when a game puts you at risk. Cash out makes it possible for you to acquire an early partial payout on all your bets. This payout occurs before the entire multibet is settled. There are bookies in Kenya who gives bettors that golden chance to acquire cash outs and these bookies are jotted in this article.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Facts to
note about cash outs</h2>



<p>For many
people, cash out becomes a possibility when they have settled for a multibet.
Nonetheless, there are instances when one can manage to acquire cash out offer
with a single bet. For example, where you have a match with team A having an
odd of 29.45 and team B having an odd of 1.12 and you choose team A, you have a
chance. The chance will only pop up when Team A takes the lead and scores a
goal ahead.</p>



<p>Well, let’s
assume you placed a bet of Ksh.1,000 and have a potential return of Ksh.29,450
if Team A wins the game. When the team scores the first goal, your prediction
becomes a valid possibility. The bookie might avail cash out offer of
Ksh.15,000. It is you to decide whether you will take the offer or you will
wait until the game is over.</p>



<p>There are other
instances when Team B scores first which lowers your chances for winning. You
might receive cash out chance but for a lesser amount than your stake money. It
is your decision whether you will take the cash out or you will remain
confident for a better outcome.</p>



<p>For the
multi bets, you need to have a selection of games and bet them together. The
games will have their differing starting time. Where you have selected ten
games and seven games have already matched your prediction, you will receive
cash out offer that is great. You are to decide whether you will cash out
before the other three games commences or you will wait. At times, you might
not have cash out offer when the remaining games start not unless it’s
half-time.</p>



<p>There comes
a time when you place a certain bet but before it starts, you experience a
change of heart. You can always cash out before the game begins. However, it is
impossible for you to cash out the entire stake amount. Therefore, you will get
some of your stake money back instead of losing everything.</p>



<p>Upon
accepting cash out, the bookie closes and settles your bet entirely. Therefore,
the anticipated outcome will never affect what you get to pocket. Whether the
remaining games win or lose, there is no turning back.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Top betting
sites with cash out offers</h2>



<p>Generally,
it is through cash outs that you lower or dispense the risk of losing your
stake money to a certain bet. Therefore, ensure to consider these bookies.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Betway</h2>



<p>Betway gives
bettors the chance to govern their bets and take control. As a matter of facts,
cash out offers gives you a chance to control the fate of your bet even before
all the games are settled. Whether you are using your smartphone app or online
platform, Betway cash out process is easy and instant. All you need to do is
keep monitoring unsettled bets and examine whether the cash out option is
available or displayed.</p>



<p>There are
instances when Betway allows its customers to acquire partial cash out. Partial
cash out enables you acquire some proportion of the cash out offer and keep the
remainder as your stake amount for the bet. The proportion remaining behind
will be settled immediately after all the matches are over and as per your
predictions.</p>



<p>There is no discrepancy
with what customer is entitled to cash out offers and which one is not
eligible. All customers are eligible for the offer.</p>



<p>The process
of cashing out your bet offers is simple. All you need is log into your Betway
account and access your bets. Therefore, ensure to click on the ‘My Bets’ icon
and then examine the bets with an eligible cash out offer. You are expected to
examine the bests and determine the ones that you need to cash out. Once you
have identified these bets, endeavor to click the ‘Cash Out’ icon available.</p>



<p>Betway has
predefined policies that govern cash outs. You need to understand that it is
not always when you will qualify for a cash out offer. Therefore, ensure to
examine those rules and terms that govern these cash outs and understand them
fully.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">BetYetu</h2>



<p>BetYetu is
somewhat limited when it comes to cash outs as they focus on multi bets.
Therefore, where you have had a set of multiple games in one bet, you can
always monitor the progress. As a result, you will manage to either lock
winnings or eliminate unwanted losses. Their cash out offers are not as
appetizing as what Betway offers but they are worthwhile.</p>



<p>Unlike
Betway where you can cash out bets placed with bonuses and free bets, Betyetu
doesn’t offer this chance. Therefore, you can only cash out bets placed with
your stake money. The process is simple and sure. All you need select ‘My
account’ on the dashboard and look for the ‘Cash Out’ option. The option will
help display bets eligible and by clicking them, you will have the money in
your wallet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">1XBET</h2>



<p>When it
comes to 1XBET, their cash out offers experience a lot of inconsistencies. It
is not always that your bets attract cash out. However, due to their high odds,
their cash out offers are impressive. Therefore, you could hit two birds with a
single stone; high odds and impressive cash out offer.</p>



<p>As a bettor,
it deems fit that you dispense the notion of recording losses all through.
Monitoring your bets regularly enables you identify all the cash out offers and
opportunities available. The opportunities help protect your investments and
money which is overly profitable.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Betika</h2>



<p>Even though Betika doesn’t have cash out feature, it allows bettor to cancel a bet. A bet, whether a single bet or a multi bet that has been predicted wrongly can be cancelled. The cancellation will allow you to have your stake amount and avoid incurring losses. A cancellation is possible within fifteen minutes after placement and where all the games are yet to start.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">22Bet Kenya</h2>



<p>You can
never guarantee thoroughness when placing a multi bet. There are instances when
you place a multi bet only to realize that some of the games were predicted
wrongly. Those wrongly predicted games are prone to mess up the entire bet
slip. In order for you to avoid encountering immense losses, you will have to
cancel the bet.</p>



<p>22Bet Kenya
understands this fact hence avails cash out feature. The feature enables you
withdraw your stake amount or part of your stake before the matches commence.
The amount that you cash out will always be deposited in your 22Bet wallet.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">SportyBet
Kenya</h2>



<p>The handwork
of your analysis on the available games is rewarded by SportyBet through cash
out offers. Nevertheless, there are terms and policies governing the cash outs.
Understanding the policies or these rules helps you understand what to expect
and how to go about the process.</p>



<p>First and
foremost, SportyBet requires your bet to have a stake amount of a hundred
shillings and above. Therefore, bets staked with less than KES 100 will never
attract cash out offers. Additionally, free bets and bonus-staked bets doesn’t
avail cash out feature.</p>



<p>It is within
the discretion of SportyBet to determine the games not eligible for cash out
offers. There is therefore no guarantee that your bet will have cash out stand.
Even if your bet was eligible for cash out, SportyBet could decide to make it
unavailable without communicating in advance or availing explanations.</p>

<p>It is important to first of all understand that not all roulette games are the same. Different <a href="https://jengacash.com/blog/top-online-casinos-in-kenya/">online casinos</a> offer a number of different roulette versions around the world. Regardless, there are common roulette games whose rules are universal. These are the games whose rules you ought to master.&nbsp; There exist two common types of roulette games. They consist of the American roulette and the European roulette. What sets these two apart is the fact that the American variation has a double (00) while the European one has only one zero (0). </p>



<p>When playing roulette, the focus is not only on the wheel that you ought to spin but more on the table from which individual bets are placed. It is only after placing the different types of bets on the table that the wheel is spun and a small ball is thrown on the spinning wheel. The number which the slot ball lands on, becomes the winning number. It is important for you to know that the layout of both&nbsp; the wheel and table are subject to change, depending on the roulette game chosen. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Bet types</h2>



<p>If you are new to roulette games, it is often
said that experience is the best teacher. The best way to understand a game
like roulette is by actually playing it. It is worth mentioning before we delve
further into the bet types that in these games, more numbers mean a higher
payout. That being mentioned, the bet types here are divided into three
different types. The three bet types are inside bets, outside bets and
announced bets. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.caesarsgames.com/2017/11/16/roulette-inside-and-outside-bets/">Inside and outside bets</a> are common for all roulette games and therefore, it is important that you grt to understand them well. Announced bets are more advanced bet types and are only found in selected roulette variant games.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Inside bets</h3>



<p>In a typical roulette game, when you look at
the basic table layout, you will notice that the main part of the table is made
up of numbers which start from 0 -36 while the rest are sectors for waging on
groups of numbers. The best placed on the numbers are called inside bets while
those placed on other sectors are called outside bets. </p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Outside bets</h3>



<p>These bets are those that cover bigger groups
of numbers are a further sub-divided into 5 types. Red or black are divisions
on the basis of color , odd or even are on the basis of whether the outcome is
odd or even while dozens means one ought to bet on either of three dozens on
the layout table. The column bet involves choosing which column will win while
(1-18) or (19-36) involves choosing whether the winning number will be lower or
higher than 19.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Outside bet</h3>



<p>In this bet type, numbers 1,5,9,12,14,
16,19,23,27,30, 32 and 34 create the shape of a snake and make it one bet type
while numbers 2, 6, 8, 10, 13, 17, 20, 24, 26, 29, 28 and 35 make another snake
belt and are considered another bet type (black snake). 17/20 numbers and 26/29
are split bets and the other bets are straight ones.</p>



<h3 class="wp-block-heading">Announced bets</h3>



<p>These are mostly featured in French roulette and also in some online European roulettes.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://jengacash.com/blog/roulette-rules-and-bet-types/">Roulette</a> may for a number of justifiable reasons be one of the most fascinating games in the casino. For a number of participants however, the game is not as fun with high losing streaks. With the help of the tips you are about to get here, your roulette experience is likely to change!</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roulette Tip #1: Beat the System</h2>



<p>The most important piece of advice on can get is for you to have in
place your own betting system. If you have trouble coming up with a
personalized betting system, you can borrow one that is working for others and
stick to it if it proves successful. The Martingale is a good betting system
that has been in place for a long time now. The idea behind thus system is that
you kick off your betting with the lowest table limit size and place your bet
on an even-odds payout bet type. By sticking to such a bet type and doubling
your bet amount each time you lose, you will get a huge payout when you
eventually win.&nbsp; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roulette Tip #2: Avoid playing American Roulette if you can</h2>



<p>If you have played both <a href="https://www.roulettephysics.com/american-or-european-roulette-wheel/">European Roulette</a> and the American one then you already know that the former is way better. If you are new, then at least now you know that the European version is better. According to the experts of both games, the European Roulette gains an edge over the American one owing to the fact that it is devoid of the 00 and has way better odds. This is one of the simplest and most basic tips anyone playing or intending to play roulette can get.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roulette Tip #3: The rat trap (0-00-1-2-3)</h2>



<p>What makes winning interesting is not just the payout but also the
odds.&nbsp; It is always advisable to go for
good odds when placing a bet. If you happen to play American Roulette, the
&#8220;rule of thumb&#8221; is to always avoid placing a bet on the 5-number combination
of 0-00-1-2-3. The reason why this is not a preferred option is because it has
the worst winning odds and a house edge of 7.89%. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roulette Tip #4: Maximize your Experience</h2>



<p>It is no secret that nobody likes to lose. While playing any Roulette
game, it is prudent that you make your money last longer so that you can get
the most out of the Roulette experience. Settling often for wagers that have an
even payout is a great way to go. These wagers that pay even money include the
Black/Red, Odd/Even and Low (1-18)/High (19-36) betting options. These wagers
bear a pay-out percentage of which is close to 50%. With regards to Roulette, a
payout of close to 50% is as good as it gets. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roulette Tip #5: Choose Combination Bets </h2>



<p>One important fact to always keep in mind is the fact that in Roulette,
not everything you see is laid out evenly. Case and point, by observing the
first, second and third 12 blocks, you will notice that they each have the same
6 red, black, even and odd. However, when you look closely at the 12th rows,
you will come to the realization that there is a slight difference in the
angles. Specifically, you will notice that the top row has 9 red and 7 black
while the middle one has 9 black and 7 red. This uneven distribution presented
a slim technique that you can capitalize on. </p>



<p>In the event that you intend on making a bet on a third of the board, it
is important that you settle for the middle or the top row. By doing this, any
color that appears majority of times ought to be equally bet on. When you do
this, incase you happen to win the row bet, your chances of winning the color
bet are quite high as well. Also,&nbsp; if it
so happens that you lose the row bet, then your chances of winning the color
bet and breaking even have not completely disappeared. You still have close to
50% chance of winning and breaking even. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roulette Tip #6: Make the most out of your bankroll</h2>



<p>A good roulette does not solely come from winning. For many people,
playing the game more is also a worthwhile experience on its own. It is
important that when you deposit cash your online casino account or when you set
aside a bankroll for gambling, that you make the most out of your experience.
Hypothetically, when you set aside Ksh. 5,000, it would be way more fun to
split it into smaller proportions so that you can be able to make the most of
your roulette experience. It is a proven fact that the more you bet, the higher
your chances of winning. </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roulette Tip #7: Save your Wins</h2>



<p>Winning or losing when it comes to gambling is inevitable. It is advisable that when you participate in any roulette type of game, you save part of the money you win. Hypothetically, if you place a bet of Ksh. 3,000 and end up winning a profit of Ksh. 2,000, it is advisable that you save 30-50% of your profit and you can plough back what is left into placing wagers. The importance of putting aside part of your winning is so that at the end of the day, you end up with a profit or even some money to try your luck another time. Some roulette games, like the <a href="https://jengacash.com/">Jengacash spin the wheel</a>, allows you to withdraw a part of your winnings instantly so you don&#8217;t make a lot of losses.</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Roulette Tip #8: Cut your losses</h2>



<p>Gambling is a 50/50 cash cow that cannot be fully depended on. It is
important for any gambler to embrace this truth before engaging in gambling.
When it comes to roulette games, the rules do not change. It is very important
that when taking part in these roulette games, you only use money which you can
afford to lose. People sometimes assume that the more money you have to gamble,
the more likely you are to win. While having more money to gamble gives you a
boost in confidence, it does not rule out the fact that gambling is a win lose
affair. Therefore, it is important that as a gambler, you only wage using money
that you can afford to lose. </p>

<p>Winning has never been as easy as it is today. With the high number of competing gambling firms, Jenga cash stands out for a number of reasons. Jenga&nbsp;Cash is a company that boasts of a simple and easy to use platform for its clients. The response time by its support system is almost instant and this makes it easier for clients to obtain feedback on any queries. Michael Wanjala from Kakamega county is one of the few lucky Kenyans to walk away with a good sum of money from <a href="https://jengacash.com/">Jenga Cash Spin Wheel</a>. His story is quite fascinating. When asked how many times he had attempted to win such a huge amount, his response surprised plenty of people. </p>



<p>It was
just his third attempt and lucky enough, he was a winner of Ksh. 250,000. On
his previous two attempts, he was able to win Ksh. 5,000 on each occasion.
Wanjala, a lively 27-year-old from Kakamega explained how he had joined Jenga
cash from the recommendation of a friend. &#8220;A friend of mine from my
village called me one afternoon and told me how he had won a total of Ksh. 25,
000 from Jenga cash,&#8221; he explained in an interview. He went further to
explain how his friend sent him a demo link that helped him learn how the
system worked. </p>



<p>&#8220;After
meeting for a few drinks later that night, I was anxious to also try my luck
and I could not wait to get back home,&#8221; said Wanjala. Upon reaching home
later that night, he decided to deposit and place a bet using Ksh. 50. To his
amazement, the night ended with him making a sum total of Ksh. 5,000. This heavily
boosted his morale and he told his friends about it the next day. Given that he
worked as security staff at a local school, he told other staff members about
it as well and they opted to try their luck. </p>



<p>On his second attempt, he made close to Ksh. 40,000, but ended up losing most of it until he was left with Ksh. 5,000. &#8220;When I had made close to Ksh. 40,000, I got overly excited and ended up making a series of bad bets and almost lost that whole amount,&#8221; he recalls. It was only after he had lost most of the money that he decided to slow down. He said that this taught him how to discipline himself when excitement got the better of him. He eventually came up with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betting_strategy">gambling strategy</a> that he said was &#8220;The real deal.&#8221; </p>



<p>This is
the strategy that he used to amass a whopping Ksh. 250,000 from Jenga cash. He
said he disciplined himself and only made bets which he felt were good. He
further limited himself from staking too much and before he knew it, his
account balance had reached staggering amounts.it was then that he opted to
withdraw. He says the money won would be used to buy a new motorcycle and the
rest he would use to start a small shop. His story is an inspiring one and
serves to show just how easy it is to win with Jenga cash Spin wheel. </p>



<p>It is often said that good things happen to bad people. In the case of Michael Mutemi, this saying could not be farther from the truth. Having struggled with a drinking problem for years, Mutemi was on the road to turning his life around. At the start of the year, he started going to church and went into rehabilitation in order to fight off his addiction. Unlike in the case of Wanjala, Mutemi had not tried gambling before. </p>



<p>In fact, the first time a friend of his from work told him about Jenga Cash Spin and Win, he totally dismissed him. Perhaps by virtue of societal conditioning, Mutemi was always of the opinion that gambling was a waste of time and only few people ever won. Being a Resident of Kitengela in Nairobi, he was inevitably sorrounded by gamblers who would eventually sway him to join Jenga Cash and Win Ksh. 200, 000. </p>



<p>In an interview, he recalled how Jenga Cash was the new craze in Kitengela where he lived and that he would hardly go a day without hearing somebody mention it. &#8220;When Jenga Cash reached in town, even women would play it because it was easy and simple to join,&#8221; he stated in an interview. For a long time now, Jenga Cash has been the &#8220;go to&#8221; Spin and Win platform for many Kenyans.</p>



<p>Its payout speed coupled up by its simple platform has made it gain admiration from many. Compared to other Spin and Win platform, Jenga Cash is praised not only for its simple to use platform but also for the fact that it has an active customer support base that promptly responds to any customer needs and also its fast and reliable payout system.</p>



<p>In the case of Mutemi, he narrated in the interview how it was when his
salary had delayed that he thought of giving Jenga Cash a try. After seeking
advice from a friend, he was able to set up his account and make his first
deposit. In just a matter of minutes, he was fully set up and ready to go.
Given that his friend had played the game before, he took him through the demo
and shared with him a few tips and tricks about how to win in Jenga Cash. </p>



<p>The first day he tried out spinning, he made a profit of around Ksh 3,000. While this was not enough to sort out his then financial troubles, the win gave him something worth more than money. It exposed him to the possibilities which Spinning had in store. Early the next day, he loaded money onto his mpesa line a deposited the money into his Jenga Cash account. After trying his luck a few dozen times with small stakes, he made a few wins and majority of his wages were losses.</p>



<p> &#8220;I went back to my friend who helped me get back part of the money I lost,&#8221; he recalled. Given he did not make any profit that day and his landlord was on his neck, he opted to try his luck that night and he went big on his bets. To his amazement, it seemed that his losing streak had come to an end. Before the night ended, he had won a sum total of Ksh 200, 000. He not only paid his rent, but went further to sort out all his debts. Mutemi&#8217;s story is a testament that indeed anyone can <a href="https://jengacash.com/blog/how-to-win-at-roulette-tips-and-tricks/">win at roulette.</a> </p>

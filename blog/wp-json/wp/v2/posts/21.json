For a number of participants however, the game is not as fun with high losing streaks. With the help of the tips you are about to get here, your roulette experience is likely to change!<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roulette Tip #1: Beat the System<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The most important piece of advice on can get is for you to have in\nplace your own betting system. If you have trouble coming up with a\npersonalized betting system, you can borrow one that is working for others and\nstick to it if it proves successful. The Martingale is a good betting system\nthat has been in place for a long time now. The idea behind thus system is that\nyou kick off your betting with the lowest table limit size and place your bet\non an even-odds payout bet type. By sticking to such a bet type and doubling\nyour bet amount each time you lose, you will get a huge payout when you\neventually win.&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roulette Tip #2: Avoid playing American Roulette if you can<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have played both <a href=\"https:\/\/www.roulettephysics.com\/american-or-european-roulette-wheel\/\">European Roulette<\/a> and the American one then you already know that the former is way better. If you are new, then at least now you know that the European version is better. According to the experts of both games, the European Roulette gains an edge over the American one owing to the fact that it is devoid of the 00 and has way better odds. This is one of the simplest and most basic tips anyone playing or intending to play roulette can get.&nbsp;&nbsp; <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roulette Tip #3: The rat trap (0-00-1-2-3)<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>What makes winning interesting is not just the payout but also the\nodds.&nbsp; It is always advisable to go for\ngood odds when placing a bet. If you happen to play American Roulette, the\n&#8220;rule of thumb&#8221; is to always avoid placing a bet on the 5-number combination\nof 0-00-1-2-3. The reason why this is not a preferred option is because it has\nthe worst winning odds and a house edge of 7.89%. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roulette Tip #4: Maximize your Experience<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is no secret that nobody likes to lose. While playing any Roulette\ngame, it is prudent that you make your money last longer so that you can get\nthe most out of the Roulette experience. Settling often for wagers that have an\neven payout is a great way to go. These wagers that pay even money include the\nBlack\/Red, Odd\/Even and Low (1-18)\/High (19-36) betting options. These wagers\nbear a pay-out percentage of which is close to 50%. With regards to Roulette, a\npayout of close to 50% is as good as it gets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roulette Tip #5: Choose Combination Bets <\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One important fact to always keep in mind is the fact that in Roulette,\nnot everything you see is laid out evenly. Case and point, by observing the\nfirst, second and third 12 blocks, you will notice that they each have the same\n6 red, black, even and odd. However, when you look closely at the 12th rows,\nyou will come to the realization that there is a slight difference in the\nangles. Specifically, you will notice that the top row has 9 red and 7 black\nwhile the middle one has 9 black and 7 red. This uneven distribution presented\na slim technique that you can capitalize on. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the event that you intend on making a bet on a third of the board, it\nis important that you settle for the middle or the top row. By doing this, any\ncolor that appears majority of times ought to be equally bet on. When you do\nthis, incase you happen to win the row bet, your chances of winning the color\nbet are quite high as well. Also,&nbsp; if it\nso happens that you lose the row bet, then your chances of winning the color\nbet and breaking even have not completely disappeared. You still have close to\n50% chance of winning and breaking even. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roulette Tip #6: Make the most out of your bankroll<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A good roulette does not solely come from winning. For many people,\nplaying the game more is also a worthwhile experience on its own. It is\nimportant that when you deposit cash your online casino account or when you set\naside a bankroll for gambling, that you make the most out of your experience.\nHypothetically, when you set aside Ksh. 5,000, it would be way more fun to\nsplit it into smaller proportions so that you can be able to make the most of\nyour roulette experience. It is a proven fact that the more you bet, the higher\nyour chances of winning. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roulette Tip #7: Save your Wins<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Winning or losing when it comes to gambling is inevitable. It is advisable that when you participate in any roulette type of game, you save part of the money you win. Hypothetically, if you place a bet of Ksh. 3,000 and end up winning a profit of Ksh. 2,000, it is advisable that you save 30-50% of your profit and you can plough back what is left into placing wagers. The importance of putting aside part of your winning is so that at the end of the day, you end up with a profit or even some money to try your luck another time. Some roulette games, like the <a href=\"https:\/\/jengacash.com\/\">Jengacash spin the wheel<\/a>, allows you to withdraw a part of your winnings instantly so you don&#8217;t make a lot of losses.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Roulette Tip #8: Cut your losses<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gambling is a 50\/50 cash cow that cannot be fully depended on. It is\nimportant for any gambler to embrace this truth before engaging in gambling.\nWhen it comes to roulette games, the rules do not change. It is very important\nthat when taking part in these roulette games, you only use money which you can\nafford to lose. People sometimes assume that the more money you have to gamble,\nthe more likely you are to win. While having more money to gamble gives you a\nboost in confidence, it does not rule out the fact that gambling is a win lose\naffair. Therefore, it is important that as a gambler, you only wage using money\nthat you can afford to lose. <\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Roulette may for a number of justifiable reasons be one of the most fascinating games in the casino.

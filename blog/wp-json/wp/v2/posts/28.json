Different <a href=\"https:\/\/jengacash.com\/blog\/top-online-casinos-in-kenya\/\">online casinos<\/a> offer a number of different roulette versions around the world. Regardless, there are common roulette games whose rules are universal. These are the games whose rules you ought to master.&nbsp; There exist two common types of roulette games. They consist of the American roulette and the European roulette. What sets these two apart is the fact that the American variation has a double (00) while the European one has only one zero (0). <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>When playing roulette, the focus is not only on the wheel that you ought to spin but more on the table from which individual bets are placed. It is only after placing the different types of bets on the table that the wheel is spun and a small ball is thrown on the spinning wheel. The number which the slot ball lands on, becomes the winning number. It is important for you to know that the layout of both&nbsp; the wheel and table are subject to change, depending on the roulette game chosen. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Bet types<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are new to roulette games, it is often\nsaid that experience is the best teacher. The best way to understand a game\nlike roulette is by actually playing it. It is worth mentioning before we delve\nfurther into the bet types that in these games, more numbers mean a higher\npayout. That being mentioned, the bet types here are divided into three\ndifferent types. The three bet types are inside bets, outside bets and\nannounced bets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.caesarsgames.com\/2017\/11\/16\/roulette-inside-and-outside-bets\/\">Inside and outside bets<\/a> are common for all roulette games and therefore, it is important that you grt to understand them well. Announced bets are more advanced bet types and are only found in selected roulette variant games.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inside bets<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In a typical roulette game, when you look at\nthe basic table layout, you will notice that the main part of the table is made\nup of numbers which start from 0 -36 while the rest are sectors for waging on\ngroups of numbers. The best placed on the numbers are called inside bets while\nthose placed on other sectors are called outside bets. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Outside bets<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These bets are those that cover bigger groups\nof numbers are a further sub-divided into 5 types. Red or black are divisions\non the basis of color , odd or even are on the basis of whether the outcome is\nodd or even while dozens means one ought to bet on either of three dozens on\nthe layout table. The column bet involves choosing which column will win while\n(1-18) or (19-36) involves choosing whether the winning number will be lower or\nhigher than 19.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Outside bet<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In this bet type, numbers 1,5,9,12,14,\n16,19,23,27,30, 32 and 34 create the shape of a snake and make it one bet type\nwhile numbers 2, 6, 8, 10, 13, 17, 20, 24, 26, 29, 28 and 35 make another snake\nbelt and are considered another bet type (black snake). 17\/20 numbers and 26\/29\nare split bets and the other bets are straight ones.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Announced bets<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>These are mostly featured in French roulette and also in some online European roulettes.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you looking to try your hand on a roulette game today?

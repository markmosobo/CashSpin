It is almost impossible to think about sports in Kenya without acknowledging how good the Men\u2019s rugby team is. Over the past decade alone, they have managed to secure slots in major rugby competitions and bring a number of trophies back home with them.\u00a0 In the 2019\/2020 World Rugby Series, the Kenyan National rugby team which is famously known as the Safari Sevens, has managed to wow its fans with a tremendous run of the campaign in which they remained unbeaten. They managed to beat both Samoa and Australia in their group stage games and those wins set them up to meet Ireland in a decider match. Despite Ireland being a hard nut to crack, the energetic Kenyan players did not disappoint. The match ended 24-24 and saw them win their first cup of the season.  The Sevens players have repeatedly been praised for their sheer physicality, vision and tremendous runs. At the Dubai Sevens Competition which was held in Dubai in 2019 to\u00a0 celebrate its 50<sup>th<\/sup> anniversary, the Kenya Sevens only managed to finish 13 after South Africa won the competition and England won second place.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Rugby Women <\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kenya Women rugby team is no\nexception. It too is becoming a household name in the competition. In October\n2019, they secured a slot in the 2020 Olympics after managing to reach the\nfinals of the Rugby African Women\u2019s competition which was held in Jemmel,\nTunisia. The Kenyan women rugby team, famously known as the Kenyan Lionesses,\nhave demonstrated their exceptional capacity to deliver on the big stage more\nthan once. In 2016 Olympics held at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, the Lionesses\nmade their appearance and wooed the crowd with a spectacular performance.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the competition that took place in Tunisia, they entered the competition as defending champions and made their dominance felt by annihilating Zimbabwe is a thumping performance that saw them win 36-5 and later completely destroyed Tunisia at the semi finals which saw them thrash Tunisia 19-0. The final of the competition was against a highly competitive South African side which saw the lionesses lose 15-14 but despite the loss, both qualified for the 2020 Women Sevens World Series to be held in Hong kong, China.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Kenya Women Volleyball<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Malkia strikers, which is the official name for the Kenyan national volleyball team, managed to secure a slot at the Tokyo Olympic Games which are scheduled to take place in 2020. This is a major achievement not only for the women\u2019s team but for the entire country. This is particularly so because Kenya has failed to qualify for the competition for over a decade. As a matter of fact, the last time the National team took part in such a competition was more than 15 years ago. In order to achieve this enormous feat, the Kenyan team gave their total commitment and overcame major hurdles such as beating the Cameroon Team, who were also the hosts of the competition and later beating Nigeria.\u00a0 For <a href=\"https:\/\/smartbusiness.co.ke\/spin-and-win-cash\/\">volleyball lovers<\/a>, this showdown between Kenya and Cameroon was dubbed &#8216;the ultimate Decider.\u2019 The match itself did not disappoint as spectators were kept at the edge of their seats with a mouth-watering performance from both sides. Their success is largely owed to their coach, who is yet to lose a match.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>7&#8217;S Men Rugby It is no secret that the Kenyan national rugby team is a world beater when it comes<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":1,"featured_media":61,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_monsterinsights_skip_tracking":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_active":false,"_monsterinsights_sitenote_note":"","_monsterinsights_sitenote_category":0,"footnotes":""},"categories":[3],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-60","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","has-post-thumbnail","hentry","category-news"],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v23.9 -

It has its headquarters in London (UK) and multiple branches in other parts of the world including Africa. This company started operating in the country back in 2016 and has been doing so till today. It is one of the few betting sites with user=friendly interface and a number of nice discounts. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>PremierBet Kenya at a glance<\/strong>.<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p> Features&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Odds&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Markets Offered&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Customer Service <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Summary<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>What is unique about this company is the\nfact that it has a number of physical shops throughout the country and you can\nmake withdrawals or place bets from these shops. Tis company offers a wide\narray of betting options which you are certain to enjoy. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>OVERALL<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>USER REVIEW 3.33 (3 votes)<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>VISIT PREMIERBET KENYA<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>In-depth Review<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Bonuses are very important if you want to penetrate a market and gain a huge customer base. Premierbet.com is alive to this fact and is offering a number of bonuses. For new members, one is entitled to up to Ksh 2,000 deposit bonus. This means that when you join and deposit Ksh 2,000 and below, you are entitled to a similar bonus amount. Despite this betting company standing out for a number of valid reasons, it&#8217;s biggest undoing is the fact that it does not offer any jackpot event. In Kenya, jackpot events are arguably the most sought after events in sports betting. Failure to have this in your artillery means that a huge number of Kenyans will prefer other sites. The company however avails the option of depositing money either through Mpesa or Airtel money. This is important since users of&nbsp; both networks can make deposits and place their bets with ease. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Homepage<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Features<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>One\nof the standout features of this site is their simple and easy to use web\ninterface. Clients like a web design that is simple and they can navigate their\nway around wit ease. This\ncompany offers just\nwhat customers need. Also, they have multiple betting options since they avail\nplenty of sports markets to clients. It is disappointing that they do not offer\nvirtual games. These games allow you to make money easy and quickly thus making\nthem a preferred betting option for a large number of Kenyans. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This company got it right by availing\nbonuses for each new member. Nothing gets to the heart of a gambler\nfaster than a free bonus. They also offer a promotion called mobile madness.\nThis is a free bet given to a member, after placing six other bets beforehand.\nThe conditions that follow the receipt of this bonus is that each of these\nteams has to have at least 1.5 odds and it has to be placed on the mobile\nversion of their website. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that they have high boosted odds make them stand out from their competitors. In given markets, this company tends to boost its odds such that you are able to win more money each time you place a bet. Their numerous incentives make it a preferred betting site for a number of Kenyans. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Registration<\/strong><\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>All you have to do is visit the PremierBet website and Click on \u201cREGISTER\u201d on the top right-hand side of the we page.

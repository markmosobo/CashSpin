Unfortunately, the number of employment opportunities created every year does not accommodate all the graduates. For this reason, the rate of unemployment continues to increase every year. With limited opportunities, bills still have to be paid; people need to eat and dress, and so on. Simply, the need for finances remains constant.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those who have been lucky enough to secure employment still have plights as they are merely able to meet their financial needs with the salaries they are earning. It is essential for people to think outside the box and think of ways they can make the extra cash.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is no better way to do so than <a href=\"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Freelancer\">working online<\/a>. The benefit of working online if you have another job is that it allows for flexibility. You can still go to your workplace, and have another thing going on the side. For the folks that are not employed, it is a great business opportunity that requires little or no startup capital.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you wondering what you can do online to make money? Here are some online job ideas in Kenya.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jengacash.com\/blog\/tendering-process-in-kenya-kenyas-tendering-absolute-guide\/\">Learn more about the Tendering Process in Kenya.<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>1. Writing Jobs<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is one of the most common online jobs in Kenya. There are tons of opportunities in this filed. You can choose either academic writing or article writing, all of which have sub-categories that you can select depending on your area of expertise or passion. To do these jobs, all you need is a computer and internet connectivity. There are several sites that bring together writers and clients, such as Upwork, Fiverr, WriterBay, Zerys, and so on.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You have to sign up to these sites and create a portfolio then start bidding for writing jobs available. The rates vary with the sites. However, writers usually get a minimum of $5 per page. Alternatively, you can work with a direct client, where you can negotiate your rates with him or her directly. Thousands of people are able to make ends meet through writing jobs.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>2. Skill-based freelancing<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have professional skills and qualifications, you do not have to work under a company to get paid for your services. There are many services you can offer in this area; it could be web development, software development, graphic design, photography, and so on. Freelancing platforms such as Fiverr, Guru, Freelancer, and many others also bring together skilled professionals and clients.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can find someone who is interested in your skills and offer them your services. You can make this your main job or even a side hustle if you are affiliated with an organization.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>3. Social media influencer<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Social media influence is becoming popular at an impressive rate in Kenya, and many media personalities are killing it. Influencers are making Ksh.5,000 to even Ksh.200,000 per most on the different social media platforms. The rates also vary with the number of followers that an influencer has on the platforms.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To get started with this job, you need to garner traffic to your website and social media pages. Creativity is also a plus, and you should also strive to become a public figure. With that, both big companies and small businesses will approach you to market their products. Just like most other online jobs, you need an internet connection, a computer, and a smartphone.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>4. Blogging<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as it involves writing, the way you make money through blogging is quite different. To get started, you need to create a blog and select a niche that you can focus on. There are tons of topics you can discuss, ranging from lifestyle, travel, business, education, and so on. Once you select a niche and a blogging platform, you can start creating quality content that will drive traffic to your blog.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more traffic your blog has, the better chance and opportunities will have for monetizing it. You can monetize your blog by promoting affiliate products, offering blogging services, hosting webinars, and even selling ad space.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5. Data entry&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Data entry is one of the simplest online jobs. They make the ideal pick if you are looking for a side hustle. Data entry involves data entry across different tools, filling forms, typing, copy-pasting data, and so on. There are close to 20 different jobs that fall under this.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clients for these online gigs can be found on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer, and so on. Data entry requires individuals that are able to work in a fast-paced environment, and you can earn up to $14 per hour for the job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/jengacash.com\/blog\/available-online-courses-in-kenya\/\">Available Online Courses in Kenya<\/a><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>6. Virtual assistant<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The business world is becoming hectic. The incorporation of technology in businesses has also had a part to play in that. Today, people hold meetings virtually, communicate through emails, fulfill orders online, and so on. Sometimes it is hard to keep up with speed, and assistance is needed.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is where virtual assistants come in. People no longer need to have assistants physically to respond to emails, schedule meetings, do research, and so on. Freelancing sites such as Upwork have people looking for virtual assistants to help them with all of that. If you can do the job, there are endless opportunities for you. In order to stand out in this field, you need to have excellent communication skills, time management skills, knowledge, and skills in different areas such as web development. The rates vary depending on the nature of the projects you will be handling. A stable internet connection and a computer are vital for this job.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of online job opportunities in Kenya. Do not beat yourself up for missing a white-collar job while you could be doing something from your home&#8217;s comfort to make money. Online jobs give you much freedom that you are not likely to find in white-collar jobs. They allow flexibility in regards to time and also give you financial freedom. You get to determine how much you want to earn in a given day.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>The number of new graduates in Kenya annually is between 15,000 to 30,000.

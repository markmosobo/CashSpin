										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>Looking for employment is one of the things you will find yourself doing at some point in your stay in Kenya. There are over 1 million registered businesses in Kenya, which some are small and medium enterprises; others are big local corporations, while others are global. These are the businesses that Kenyans send their resumes to, looking to secure a job.</p>



<p>While there are so many things that you should consider when choosing a company to look for a job, salary is the main thing that people consider. This brings us to the question, where do you find well-paying companies in Kenya?</p>



<p>If you are looking for a company that will give you a good paycheck regardless of your experience, the following list will come in handy.</p>



<p><strong>1. United Nations</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://kenya.un.org/en/about/about-the-un#:~:text=Kenya%20was%20admitted%20to%20United,the%20UN's%20headquarters%20in%20Africa.">Kenya United Nations</a> offices house several UN agencies, which include UNEP, WFP, un-Habitat, UNDP, and WHO, to mention a few. The objective of the organization is to promote sustainable and sound urban development programs.                                     </p>



<p>Compared to their counterparts in the public and private sector, the UN’s remuneration for their staff is outstanding. A qualified professional in the UN gets an average of Ksh.100,000 more than a professional with similar qualifications in the public sector. On top of the standard remuneration, if you are working for the UN, you are going to receive a myriad of other benefits, including but not limited to housing allowance, medical cover, and much more.</p>



<p>More so, if some of the benefits in their packages are not available in the country, they are given compensation for the same. The annual salary of an entry-level professional in the UN can be up to Ksh. 5,000,000 while that of a senior professional is about Ksh. 10,000,000.</p>



<p><strong>2. Centum Investment Company Limited</strong></p>



<p>Centum Investment is a leading investment company listed in the NSE. Centum is a government-owned Industrial and Commercial development company. The company was started in 1967, and has since grown to become the success it is today.</p>



<p>Centum is one of the best-paying companies in Kenya today, boasting the most motivated and satisfied employees across the country. If you look at the salary scale of Centum limited, you will be impressed. Starting from the least earning employees in this company are the interns who take home a monthly salary of up to Ksh.27,000. You are not likely to get this amount as an intern working for most of the companies in Kenya.</p>



<p>An operations analyst at Centum Investment company bags about Ksh.146,000 every month. A personal assistant gets about Ksh.155,000 every month while an employee in operations earns Ksh.261,000. If you are looking for an employment opportunity with good compensation, you should always consider being on the lookout for Centum Investment Company career opportunities.</p>

<p><strong>3. British American Tobacco (BAT)</strong></p>



<p>British American Tobacco is part of the global British American Tobacco Group and a leading tobacco company in the world. BAT to Kenya is much more than the leading tobacco manufacturer. The company gives the locals the most competitive remunerations in the country.</p>



<p>The average salary at British American Tobacco is Ksh.70,000. To break it down further for you to understand the packages the company gives its employees, a management trainee at BAT gets not less than Kah.84,000 per month. A procurement manager, on the other hand, receives a salary of $140,000. The company offers tons of rewarding career opportunities, and nothing should stop you from trying your luck.</p>



<p><strong>4. Central Bank of Kenya</strong></p>



<p>In 1966, the Central Bank of Kenya was established by an Act of Parliament. The bank is anchored in the Constitution and is mandated to formulate and implement the monetary policy geared at promoting liquidity, solvency, and stability. Having been in operation for about 54 years, the bank has played a significant role in fulfilling its mandate of ensuring economic stability in the country.</p>



<p>The Central Bank of Kenya is among the best-paying companies in the country. Looking at the salary scales of the company, you will realize that the paychecks are motivating compared to most from other public and private sectors.</p>



<p>Fresh graduates employees get a paycheck of Ksh.120,000 to Ksh.180,000. This salary in some companies can only be given to managers. For entry-level employees, this is an impressive remuneration. Junior staff, security, clerks, and receptionists earn between Ksh.40,000 and Ksh.150,000.</p>



<p>If you are a supervisor at the Central Bank of Kenya, you should not expect to take home anything less than Ksh.200,000 every month. Managers earn between Ksh.400,000 and Ksh.800,000, while senior managers can take up to Ksh.1 million.</p>



<p>While the salaries are so rewarding, it is worth noting that you have to prove yourself to get recruited at the Central Bank of Kenya. Most employees start as interns. If you manage to impress the management at the internship level, you can get hired at the company. The Central Bank of Kenya advertises internship opportunities from time to time. If you are looking to have a future at the company, watch out for the opportunities: this is where your career journey at CBK starts.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><a href="https://fsdkenya.org/tag/mobile-lending/">Digital lending</a> in Kenya has been on the rise in the past few years. Many financial institutions and third-party lending companies have made it possible for Kenyans to access credit instantly. There are about 50 lending platforms currently. Many Kenyans opt for these types of loans because they can use them in case of an emergency or if they have to make quick payments. All you need is a good phone and access to the internet.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Factors to consider when applying for a mobile loan</strong></h1>



<p>Not all apps that purport to offer mobile loans are genuine. Some fraudsters put up fake lending apps intending to steal from applicants by requesting for registration fees.

<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Check the company profile (How long have they been in business)</li><li>Company address (Do they have a physical address?)</li><li>Read customer reviews</li><li>Avoid apps that prompt you to pay some registration fees or other fees</li><li>Check their interest rates and compare them with other lenders.</li><li>Confirm loan duration. (one week, two weeks, one month, three months)</li><li>Understand the payment procedures</li><li>Customer service. (Who or how will you contact them in case of an issue?)</li><li>&nbsp;</li></ul>



<p><strong>How to Qualify for a mobile loan</strong></p>



<p>Lending depends on an individual’s credit history. Not every customer that applies gets approved. To qualify, for a loan ensure that you;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p>With more and more people trying to make use of the readily available internet connectivity to earn a living, Kenya is gradually becoming a hub for forex trading. Some people know it as forex, others as foreign exchange but FX is quite popular. Compared to other markets, forex trading is not only the largest but also the most liquid. Except for Sundays, this global market is open 24 hours. If you can imagine $3 trillion exchanging hands on a single day, then you can appreciate the gigantic nature of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Foreign_exchange_market">online forex trading.</a></p>



<p>Are you based in Kenya and have been thinking of trying out forex trading? The good news is that trading regulations have been enhanced to safeguard the interests of the retailer.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to trade forex in Kenya</strong></h4>



<p>The law that regulates online forex exchange in Kenya was enacted in 2017. The Capital Markets Authority is tasked with enforcing this law. Currently, CMA provides interested parties with any of the following licenses;</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>Dealing Foreign Exchange Broker</li><li>Non-Dealing Foreign Exchange Broker</li><li>Money Manager</li></ul>



<p>Having a Dealing Broker or Non-Dealing Broker license means that you are allowed to provide derivative foreign exchange instruments but cannot support clients with investment management. With a Money Manager license, one is authorized to manage forex exchange portfolios on behalf of clients. As an individual forex trader, you are not regulated by CMA. In Kenya currently, only 3 Non-Dealing Online Brokerages and 1 money manager are licensed by CMA. To trade in forex through a brokerage, a commission (or spread) is charged.  Broker charges vary from business to business.</p>



<p><a href="https://jengacash.com/blog/mobile-loans-in-kenya/">Get more Information about the Mobile Loans in Kenya</a></p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Getting started in forex trading</strong>.</h4>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="1"><li>The firsts step in foreign exchange dealing is due diligence. It is important to go through the accounts offered by a broker before signing up. The resources at your disposal plus your needs as an investor should be the guide to picking the most suitable account.</li><li>You can now proceed to create an account by filling an online application form. This step also entails providing personal information (Know Your Customer information).</li><li>Your registration is deemed complete after the broker’s website gives you a set of login credentials (username and password). This is what you will use to access the client portal on the website.</li><li>It is best to start your forex trading with a demo account so as to gain confidence and master the trends. With an account in your name, all you need to start earning is to deposit funds into your client account.</li></ol>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>How to choose a forex broker</strong></h4>



<p>As an investor, you are obviously aware of the risks involved in doing business but it is equally wise to be cautious. A broker that is regulated and operates within the guidelines of the CMA is preferred in this line of business. Why is the CMA involvement important?</p>



<p>The CMA helps in ensuring that all money invested for purposes of foreign exchange trading serves the intended purpose. The regulator protects investors from organizations that may otherwise abuse such funds by engaging in fraudulent activities.</p>



<p>The CMA also keeps an eye on invested resources to prevent diversion of funds for selfish gain. In the event that an investor feels that their money has been misused, the judiciary will act as an independent dispute resolution agent.                                                                                                               <strong>The only 3 Non-Dealing Online Brokers in Kenya operating under CMA are;</strong></p>



<ol class="wp-block-list" type="1"><li>EGM Securities which operates FXPesa</li><li>SCFM Limited</li><li>Pepperstone Kenya</li></ol>



<p>While it is a matter of personal choice whether to use a local or foreign broker, the CMA discourages against using brokerage firms in other jurisdictions. Those who are willing to take the risk for whatever reason must ensure that they sign up with brokers that are regulated. Some of the reputable offshore regulatory bodies are ASIC of Australia, FCA of UK and CySEC of Cyprus. These regulators that ensure all investors have a safe and fair trading environment.</p>



<p>Customer support and easy access to funds are key considerations when picking any broker for your forex investment needs. A broker needs to have a local support system as well as facilitate easy deposits/withdrawals.</p>



<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Risks of trading in Forex</strong>.</h4>



<p>Like with any other form of business, forex trading has its high and low moments. The risk associated with this business however is way more than exists with traditional investments such as shares. Some common risks you should expect are;</p>



<p><strong>High Leverage</strong> – sometimes investors borrow money from brokers to leverage their returns. The market may fluctuate negatively leading to greater loss than the money invested.</p>



<p><strong>High Volatility</strong> – the volatile nature of the forex market lures many short term investors. It is this very feature that often times backfires on many. The forex market is closed on weekends so any developments that could lead to loss happening over this time might be the cause of significant loss of investment.</p>



<p><strong>Liquidity Issues</strong> – on the larger scale, traders are able to access or invest funds easily. There is however low liquidity reported on weekends and bank holidays.</p>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Forex trading scams</strong></h4>



<p>As a new trader venturing into the uncertain waters of forex, it is important to keep safe. An easy way is to ensure that the broker you are just about to sign up with has a CMA license. To fully understand the extent of real-life scam cases in this business, look up publications on the VIP portal of 2013. What are some red flags that a broker could scam you?</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list"><li>They offer you “professional recommendations” on best times to trade but at a fee.</li><li>They claim that any money invested with them keeps earning even when the traders are asleep.</li><li>They claim an irresistible offer to double or grow your investment</li></ul>

<h4 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>Conclusion</strong>.</h4>



<p>The risks associated with the Forex market are real and have been quite a setback to some hopeful investors. Since the global economy thrives on foreign exchange, the money markets cannot be ignored. The best approach to trading with forex would be information gathering followed by practice using demo accounts. If you trade in a regulated environment, then you are entitled to legal redress should something go wrong.</p>

<p>The number of new graduates in Kenya annually is between 15,000 to 30,000. Unfortunately, the number of employment opportunities created every year does not accommodate all the graduates. For this reason, the rate of unemployment continues to increase every year. With limited opportunities, bills still have to be paid; people need to eat and dress, and so on. Simply, the need for finances remains constant.</p>



<p>Those who have been lucky enough to secure employment still have plights as they are merely able to meet their financial needs with the salaries they are earning. It is essential for people to think outside the box and think of ways they can make the extra cash.</p>



<p>There is no better way to do so than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freelancer">working online</a>. The benefit of working online if you have another job is that it allows for flexibility. You can still go to your workplace, and have another thing going on the side. For the folks that are not employed, it is a great business opportunity that requires little or no startup capital.</p>



<p>Are you wondering what you can do online to make money? Here are some online job ideas in Kenya.</p>



<p><a href="https://jengacash.com/blog/tendering-process-in-kenya-kenyas-tendering-absolute-guide/">Learn more about the Tendering Process in Kenya.</a></p>



<p><strong>1. Writing Jobs</strong></p>



<p>This is one of the most common online jobs in Kenya. There are tons of opportunities in this filed. You can choose either academic writing or article writing, all of which have sub-categories that you can select depending on your area of expertise or passion. To do these jobs, all you need is a computer and internet connectivity. There are several sites that bring together writers and clients, such as Upwork, Fiverr, WriterBay, Zerys, and so on.</p>



<p>You have to sign up to these sites and create a portfolio then start bidding for writing jobs available. The rates vary with the sites. However, writers usually get a minimum of $5 per page. Alternatively, you can work with a direct client, where you can negotiate your rates with him or her directly. Thousands of people are able to make ends meet through writing jobs.</p>



<p><strong>2. Skill-based freelancing</strong></p>



<p>If you have professional skills and qualifications, you do not have to work under a company to get paid for your services. There are many services you can offer in this area; it could be web development, software development, graphic design, photography, and so on. Freelancing platforms such as Fiverr, Guru, Freelancer, and many others also bring together skilled professionals and clients.</p>



<p>You can find someone who is interested in your skills and offer them your services. You can make this your main job or even a side hustle if you are affiliated with an organization.</p>



<p><strong>3. Social media influencer</strong></p>



<p>Social media influence is becoming popular at an impressive rate in Kenya, and many media personalities are killing it. Influencers are making Ksh.5,000 to even Ksh.200,000 per most on the different social media platforms. The rates also vary with the number of followers that an influencer has on the platforms.</p>



<p>To get started with this job, you need to garner traffic to your website and social media pages. Creativity is also a plus, and you should also strive to become a public figure. With that, both big companies and small businesses will approach you to market their products. Just like most other online jobs, you need an internet connection, a computer, and a smartphone.</p>



<p><strong>4. Blogging</strong></p>



<p>As much as it involves writing, the way you make money through blogging is quite different. To get started, you need to create a blog and select a niche that you can focus on. There are tons of topics you can discuss, ranging from lifestyle, travel, business, education, and so on. Once you select a niche and a blogging platform, you can start creating quality content that will drive traffic to your blog.</p>



<p>The more traffic your blog has, the better chance and opportunities will have for monetizing it. You can monetize your blog by promoting affiliate products, offering blogging services, hosting webinars, and even selling ad space.</p>



<p><strong>5. Data entry&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Data entry is one of the simplest online jobs. They make the ideal pick if you are looking for a side hustle. Data entry involves data entry across different tools, filling forms, typing, copy-pasting data, and so on. There are close to 20 different jobs that fall under this.</p>



<p>Clients for these online gigs can be found on platforms such as Upwork, Freelancer, and so on. Data entry requires individuals that are able to work in a fast-paced environment, and you can earn up to $14 per hour for the job.</p>



<p><a href="https://jengacash.com/blog/available-online-courses-in-kenya/">Available Online Courses in Kenya</a></p>



<p><strong>6. Virtual assistant</strong></p>



<p>The business world is becoming hectic. The incorporation of technology in businesses has also had a part to play in that. Today, people hold meetings virtually, communicate through emails, fulfill orders online, and so on. Sometimes it is hard to keep up with speed, and assistance is needed.</p>



<p>This is where virtual assistants come in. People no longer need to have assistants physically to respond to emails, schedule meetings, do research, and so on. Freelancing sites such as Upwork have people looking for virtual assistants to help them with all of that. If you can do the job, there are endless opportunities for you. In order to stand out in this field, you need to have excellent communication skills, time management skills, knowledge, and skills in different areas such as web development. The rates vary depending on the nature of the projects you will be handling. A stable internet connection and a computer are vital for this job.</p>



<p>There are plenty of online job opportunities in Kenya. Do not beat yourself up for missing a white-collar job while you could be doing something from your home&#8217;s comfort to make money. Online jobs give you much freedom that you are not likely to find in white-collar jobs. They allow flexibility in regards to time and also give you financial freedom. You get to determine how much you want to earn in a given day.</p>

                            for all damages resulting from the culpable non-observance of the obligations of these terms and conditions. Users release

                            violation of their rights by content posted by the user or due to a violation of other obligations. Users shall assume 
                            the costs of CashSpin Limited legal defense, including all court and legal fees. This condition does not apply if the 
                            user is not responsible for the infringement.</p>
                        <p>6.2 The liability of CashSpin Limited, on whatever legal grounds, whether due to contractual misconduct or a breach of 
                            duty, is ultimately determined in accordance with the following rules:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>6.2.1 If CashSpin Limited provides the respective liability-causing service free of charge, CashSpin Limited is liable only for malice and gross negligence.</li>
                            <li>6.2.2 In the case of non-gratuitous services, CashSpin Limited liability is limited to cases of malice and gross negligence,
                                 but unlimited in cases of personal injury. In cases of slight negligence, however, CashSpin Limited will only be liable 
                                 for a breach of essential contractual obligations such as delay or unavailability which CashSpin Limited is held responsible 
                                 for. In the case of a breach of an essential contractual obligation, liability is limited to the typical contractual damages 
                                 that CashSpin Limited had to calculate upon conclusion of the contract due to the circumstances prevailing at this time.
                                 <br>"Essential contractual obligations", as previously stated, are the obligations that may be relied upon by the user and 
                                 that ensure that the contract runs in accordance with its regulations and achieves the contractual aim.</li>
                            <li>6.2.3 CashSpin Limited assumes no liability for interruptions within the network that are not the fault of CashSpin Limited.</li>
                            <li>6.2.4 CashSpin Limited is liable for a loss of data in accordance with the foregoing paragraphs only if such a 
                                loss could not have been avoided by adequate backup measures taken by the user.</li>
                            <li>6.2.5 The aforementioned liability limitations do not apply in cases of explicit guarantees made by 
                                CashSpin Limited, in cases of malice, and for damages due to the loss of life, limb, or health. Liability 
                                shall remain unaffected under the Product Liability Act.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>7.2 The contract may be terminated by either party at any time with immediate effect, provided that a temporary contract period has not been agreed.</p>
                        <p>7.3 Either party has the right to terminate the contract for good cause without giving a period of notice. "Good cause" constitutes, in particular, if:</p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>A user has defaulted on payment of the fees, and does not pay despite reminders.</li>
                            <li>A behavior significantly affecting the game experience of other players is being displayed.</li>
                            <li>Cheats, mods, and/or "hacks" as well as any other form of software, tools, or scripts that alter the 
                                gaming experience or the game mechanism of online or mobile games are being used.</li>
                            <li>Third parties make use of a user's account, unless the rules of the game allow for specific exceptions.</li>

                                unless the rules of the game allow for specific exceptions.</li>
                            <li>A user uses virtual items being used in online or mobile games outside of the online or mobile games, 
                                attempts to buy or sell these virtual items for "real" money, or tries to trade them.</li>
                            <li>A user has sold, bought, or traded a user account.</li>
                            <li>The user culpably violates laws that serve to protect other players or CashSpin Limited.</li>
                            <li>The user deliberately violates these general terms and conditions, additional governing provisions, and/or the rules of the game.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>7.4 Termination must always be made in writing. Terminations sent via email are considered to have been made in writing.</p>
                        <p>7.5 In the case of extended inactivity, CashSpin Limited is entitled to delete the inactive user account after giving prior 
                            notice of this and only after at least 3 months of inactivity. Moreover, CashSpin Limited is entitled to delete a user account 
                            at the end of the contract at its own discretion.</p>
